		 * @brief The Package Merge Algorithm is a subset of the knapsack problem that can be solved in sudo linear time.
         *      This implementation is not the fastest since it requires sorting.
         *      It is primarily used to solve for length limited huffman codes.
		 * @param baseItems 
		 * 		A vector of Grouping structs. Width is the value and weight is the cost of using the item.
         *      Width must be a power of 2.
         *      valid is an internal tool and should be left as true.
         *      unique ids should be set by the user. This allows the user to get the selected items. Only one should be set per item.
         * @param desiredTotal
         *      The desired total to hit.
         * 
         * @return std::vector<Grouping>
         *      The algorithm returns a list of a single Grouping if successful.
         *      The Grouping contains the total weight and the ids of all items used.
