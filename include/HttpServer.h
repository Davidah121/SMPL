//A bit on Range Size Limit:
//
//      This is the maximum size of a buffer to be sent. Must be greater than 64KB. A good size is about 16MB as shown below.
//
//      The following is done assuming 16MB size limit.
//      Assuming 10 milliseconds between sends and time for reading and loading a new job is negligable,
//          This hits 1.6 Gigabytes per second or 12.8 Gigabit per second
//      Adding in the other things for usb 2.0 hard drive speeds (about 140 Megabytes per second) and a max of 10 milliseconds between jobs (assuming no real load),
//          110 milliseconds to load data, 10 to get to the job, 10 milliseconds to send so approx = 130 milliseconds per 16MB
//          which is about 123 Megabytes per second or 984 Megabit per second
//          If sends are buffered, as long as you load in enough data into the socket and the time to load the data is fast enough, the network will be saturated.
//              IFF sends are buffered. (Data is not sent directly but put into a buffer for the kernel to send later).
//      Switching to a faster medium like an SATA SSD (about 550 Megabytes per second),
//          30 milliseconds to load data, 10 millis to get to the job, 10 millis to send so approx = 50 milliseconds per 16MB
//          which is about 320 Megabytes per second or 2560 Megabit per second
